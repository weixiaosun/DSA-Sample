# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

## What is this

This repository contains implementations of hash maps, heaps, sorts, priority queues, tries, and other various data structures and algorithms.
I implemented these for my Data Structures and Algorithms class at UCI. It is broken up into 5 programs, by folders.

### Program 1

Programming using the ICS-46 Template Library
Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, Set, and Map 

### Program 2

Implementing Queue/Priority Queue/Set with Linked Lists 

### Program 3

Implementing Priority Queues and Maps with Binary Trees 

### Program 4

Implementing Maps and Sets via Hash Tables 

### Program 5

Implementing Graphs and Dijkstra's Algorithm 

## What makes you proud of this code?

This particular code (series of coding assignments) is proof to myself that I can be a successful problem solver. I used to study premed and eventually switched my major to the department of informatics, a branch of computer science. When I was applying for software engineering internships, I was rejected left and right because I was not able to pass the technical interviews, which were data structure heavy/algorithm heavy in nature. Informatics deals with programming, but only enough to understand how to effectively work with other software engineers in the workplace. Because of that, never felt qualified. I was passionate about coding, I had tons of side projects under my belt, but I didn’t feel like I wasn’t good enough. I was driven to show everyone and myself that I was capable, so I took an extra class at school on data structures and algorithms. I ended up with an A+, placing 11th out of the 200 students in that class. This repository contains implementations of hash maps, heaps, sorts, priority queues, tries, and other various data structures and algorithms. It is a culmination of the hard work that I did to prove that I can learn these “complex” topics like anyone else. Moreover, it signifies what I learned about myself: whatever happens in interviews or in life, for that matter, does not mean anything about who I am. That realization is what truly makes me proud.
